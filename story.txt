Hidden behind a growth of the bushes I discovered what appeared to a hole in the side of a hill, 'Could this be an entrance to a cove?', I asked
my best friend who was with me. She didn't had any reply, it seemed that she was also with the same question; beacuse her body language and
her expressions told me everything.As we say body language tells much more than the person's speech. We both then went inside the hole; it was quite a 
big one. Suddenly we both slipped and we were sliding down. It was a very steep slope, but it was a horrific place when we stopped sliding. We 
thought there must something like  te=resure. The place was all covered with bones and weird sounds were howling around. Even there were the
scratches on the wall of the cave. They were much similar to the werewolf scratches.
