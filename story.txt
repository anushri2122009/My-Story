Hidden behind a growth of the bushes I discovered what appeared to a hole in the side of a hill, 'Could this be an entrance to a cove?', I asked
my best friend who was with me. She didn't had any reply, it seemed that she was also with the same question; beacuse her body language and
her expressions told me everything.As we say body language tells much more than the person's speech. We both then went inside the hole; it was quite a 
big one. Suddenly we both slipped and we were sliding down.
